# GreenBite – UX Design Project (HCI)

GreenBite is a mobile application designed to support university students in adopting and maintaining healthy eating habits. Through a structured UX process based on HCI principles, we researched, designed, and evaluated a user-centered solution to address dietary challenges among students with limited time and budget.

##  Project Description

This UX project was developed for the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) course and aims to solve the problem of poor dietary habits due to lack of time, resources, and knowledge among university students. The application facilitates recipe discovery, meal planning, and product scanning to help users make informed decisions quickly and easily.

## Strategy

Our approach followed Jesse James Garrett's Elements of User Experience. The **Strategy Plane** helped define both business goals and user needs. Based on our research:

- **Users**: Students aged 18–30, living alone, with low budgets and limited time.
- **User Needs**: Quick recipes, dietary suggestions, ingredient info, and budget management.
- **Project Goals**: Create an accessible, engaging, and personalized food app to support healthy living.

## UX Personas

Three user personas were defined to guide design decisions:

1. **Busy Learner** – Struggles with time and knowledge for meal planning.
2. **Health Seeker** – Interested in healthy choices but lacks support tools.
3. **Low-Budget Cook** – Prioritizes savings while wanting better food options.

##  Customer Journey Map

The CJM visualizes the user flow from initial app discovery to long-term engagement:

| Phase | Actions | Emotions | Goals |
|-------|---------|----------|-------|
| Awareness | Discover app via posters or social media | Curious | Evaluate usefulness |
| Onboarding | Enter preferences, allergies, time, budget | Motivated | Receive personalized suggestions |
| Use | Explore recipes, scan products, plan meals | Confident | Improve eating habits |
| Retention | Save favorites, track meals, reuse plans | Empowered | Maintain consistency |

---

## Benchmarking

We evaluated 4 nutrition-focused applications:

| App | Key Features |
|-----|--------------|
| **MyRealFood** | Barcode scanning for food classification and tracking |
| **GoCoCo** | Nutritional scanning with product categorization |
| **Lifesum** | Personalized meal plans and macro tracking |
| **Ekilu** | Filtered recipes, daily progress feedback |

This comparison helped us identify unique value additions for GreenBite like **budget-based filtering** and **scanner-integrated planning**.

## Wireframes

Low-fidelity wireframes guided our early design thinking and testing:

- Onboarding screens (preferences, allergies, cooking time)
- Recipe suggestions and filters
- Profile and diet history
- Barcode scanner and weekly planner

## High-Fidelity Mockups

The final UI designs, detailed in [`Avance 1`](./HCI_UX%20Avance%201.pdf), show the visual language of GreenBite:

- Consistent color palette and typographic hierarchy
- Profile customization
- Recipe exploration by category and nutrition
- Planning tools and favorite recipes
